CppSparse: A C++ sparse matrix library with Python bindings
===========================================================

About
-----
I have been fascinated with sparse direct solvers ever since I
encountered them whilst learning finite element analysis back during
my undergraduate days. One particularly clever trick that stood out
was the *multi-frontal* method developed by Bruce M. Irons
[Irons1970]_ back in the 1960s that performed Gaussian elimination on
the stiffness matrix *while it was being assembled* in the usual
element-by-element fashion.

As a graduate student, I was fortunate enough to re-learn finite
element methods from Prof. K-J Bathe. One of the intriguing aspects of
sparse solvers he mentioned in his class was the use of methods based
on graph theory that had surpassed classical *skyline* solvers such as
COLSOL described in his book [Bathe1995]_. This was the first time I
had heard about the connection between finite element methods and
graph theory - two very distinct worlds that are deeply connected at a
rather profound level. Although my curiosity was piqued, I did not dig
deeper into sparse solvers until 2006 when I noticed an announcement
in SIAM News about an upcoming book by Tim Davis on sparse direct
solvers [Davis2006]_ and immediately preordered it.

I started reading Davis' book in earnest during Fall 2006 and quickly
realized that the only way I was going to benefit from the book was to
digest the (rather terse) algorithms and reimplement them myself along
with tackling all the exercises. Unfortunately, this has been a rather
painstaking process and progress was glacially slow until 2011 when I
resolved to finally dedicate a part of my weekends to understand
sparse solvers, matrix reordering algorithms and the graph theoretical
foundations of sparse linear solvers.

*CppSparse* has been the result of my work so far. It is a sparse matrix
library based on the algorithms and exercises in Tim Davis' book. It
is implemented in C++ and extensively uses the containers and
algorithms in the standard library. This allows me to elide details
such as checking for out-of-memory conditions or managing the
lifetime of my temporary buffers. The templated nature of *CppSparse*
allows it to be used in both 32- and 64-bit libraries and the same
code base supports both real and complex-valued sparse matrices.

*CppSparse* is distributed as a self-contained header-only library. It
has very few dependencies besides a half-decent C++ compiler. I
primarily use *CppSparse* through its Python bindings and aim for it
to be a fully-featured sparse matrix library for Python.

Building CppSparse
------------------
*CppSparse* currently reliably builds on Windows using Microsoft
Visual Studio 2010 and MingW GCC 4.5 (64-bit) and is tested with
64-bit Python 2.7 and NumPy. I also occassionally build it on my Mac
OS Snow Leopard and back-port the changes to Windows.

Some of the routines in *CppSparse* use C++11 features such as lambda
expressions that are not supported out-of-the-box on the older GCC
installed on Snow Leopard; I will eventually remove these features
once I have completed a few more chapters in Davis' book. I also had
move constructors on the matrix classes that I disabled because SWIG
seemed to choke on them.

Prequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~
* `SWIG`_ version 2.0.1 or better for generating the Python bindings
* `Microsoft Windows 7 SDK (64-bit)`_ that contains the 64-bit version of the Visual C++ compiler, or, 
* `MingW64`_ with GCC 4.5 or better for compiling the generated bindings
* `Python`_ 64-bit version 2.7 or better (I have not tested *CppSparse* with Python 3.x)
* `NumPy`_ compatible with your Python installation. You can get a 64-bit installer for Windows from `Ch. Golke`_ 's website.
* `GraphViz`_ (optional). Some of the functions generate graphs in the GraphViz format; you can use tools like ``dot`` to post-process these graphs and create pretty pictures.

Building with the Microsoft C++ compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Ensure that SWIG is in your path.
* Start up a 64-bit Visual C++ command prompt, navigate to the source
  directory and run ``buildswig.bat``. 

Building with MingW GCC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Ensure that SWIG and GCC are in your path.
* Navigate to the source directory and run ``make -f Makefile.mingw``

Future plans
------------
* Finish Cholesky factorization
  - Numerical factorization and 
  - Column Cholesky factorization are still pending
* Work on QR factorization
* Work on LU factorization
* Work on reordering techniques (phew!)
* Make all return types be ``std::shared_ptr`` so they don't get
  copied constantly in SWIG.
* Add more PyUnit tests
* Finish matrix arithmetic operations
* ...
